# Triangle Checker 🛠️

## Project Overview
This project is a simple program that determines the **type of a triangle** based on three side lengths provided by the user.  
The program identifies whether the triangle is:  

- **Equilateral** – all sides are equal  
- **Isosceles** – two sides are equal  
- **Scalene** – all sides are different  
- **Not a valid triangle** – if the sides do not satisfy the triangle inequality  

This project demonstrates:  
- Using **Python** for basic calculations  
- **Input validation**  
- **Conditional statements** for logic  
- **Debugging** and bug tracking workflow with GitHub  

---

## Features ✅
- Accepts three side lengths from the user  
- Checks if the sides can form a valid triangle  
- Identifies triangle type: Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene  
- Handles invalid input (e.g., negative numbers, zero)  

---

## Requirements 📝
- Python 3.x installed on your system  
- Basic understanding of running Python scripts  

---

## Bug Reporting & Debugging 🐞
- Bugs can be reported using the **GitHub Issues** tab.  
- Example bug: entering negative numbers or non-numeric input.  
- The program includes basic input validation to prevent crashes.  
- After fixing bugs, changes can be **committed and linked to the issue**.
